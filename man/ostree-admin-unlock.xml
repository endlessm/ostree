        <para>
	  Remove the read-only bind mount on <literal>/usr</literal>
	  and replace it with a writable overlay filesystem.  This
	  default invocation of "unlock" is intended for
	  development/testing purposes.  All changes in the overlay
	  are lost on reboot.  However, this command also supports
	  "hotfixes", see below.

                current deployment will be cloned as a rollback
                target.  This option is intended for things like
                emergency security updates to userspace components
                such as <literal>sshd</literal>.  The semantics here
		differ from the default "development" unlock mode
		in that reboots will retain any changes (which is what
		you likely want for security hotfixes).
