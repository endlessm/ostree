(This README is correct as of 2019-09-19.)

The packaging in this branch is based on debian's git repo at
https://salsa.debian.org/debian/ostree.git. When updating, changes
should be based on the debian/<upstream>-<package> tag in that repo.

The Endless OSTree package differs a little from upstream Debian OSTree,
since we don't use the full OSTree grub integration. See
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=824650 for the Debian
status of things.

Ways in which the Endless package differs from Debian:
 1. We donâ€™t use the full OSTree grub integration (etc/grub.d/15_ostree,
    usr/libexec/libostree/grub2-15_ostree). (See T18848.)
 2. We carry some custom patches which change the repository format to
    store extra data about commit sizes, which was used a long time ago in
    the client update UI. (See T17367.)
 3. We re-enable gjs build dependency as we have a way to install/test it
 4. We bring back trivial-httpd subcommand

#1, #3 and #4 can be fixed at some point in the future (especially #3 and #4
if debian decides to re-add the support).
However #2 cannot be entirely fixed, since we will always need some
compatibility code for generating the additional metadata on the server side.
However, it could potentially be moved out of the OSTree package (T17367).
