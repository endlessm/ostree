    We still build-depend on libsoup2.4, because it's used in the test suite
    and installed-tests. (Closes: #1016589)

    Skip `gpg-connect-agent` when cleaning up temporary GPG home
    directories. It appears this is sometimes done when it wasn't
    needed, causing gpg-connect-agent to wait for an agent to start so
    that it can tell it to stop, which results in a lot of noise on stderr
    when running `flatpak update`. Debian 10 has GPG 2.2, and according to
    the commit message of the commit I'm reverting here, this cleanup

  * New upstream release
    - d/copyright: Upstream clarified that only doc/ is CC-BY-SA-3.0 or
      GFDL-1.3-or-later, and doc/ isn't included in dist tarballs, so
      remove those licenses
    - d/libostree-1-1.symbols: Update (and sort)
    - d/p/Don-t-write-to-parent-repo.patch: Drop, applied upstream
    - d/ostree-boot.install: Add new systemd service
      lib/systemd/system/ostree-finalize-staged.service
    - d/rules: Remove lib/systemd/system/ostree-finalize-staged.service
      until we build ostree-boot
  * ostree-tests: Add Lintian override for library-not-linked-against-libc.
    libreaddir-rand.so genuinely doesn't use any libc ABIs directly, only
    via GLib.

  * Temporarily disable gjs tests. gjs is not currently installable on
    buildds due to the glibc transition and a long dependency chain
    involving systemd-shim being preferred over systemd-sysv, which
    ends with libnih1 Depends: libc6 (<< 2.26).

  * Disable gtk-doc if we are not going to build libostree-doc,
    in particular for architecture-specific builds. Note that it remains
    in Build-Depends (not Build-Depends-Indep) because it is also needed
    for gtkdocize during dh_autoreconf.

    Add more test coverage from upstream
    - d/rules: Make the new test executable

  * New upstream release
    - Drop all current patches, applied upstream
    - Update symbols file
  * Add some post-release bug fix patches
  * Simplify autopkgtest now that test-local-pull seems to be stable
  * Unexport HTTP proxy variables in autopkgtest to work around lack of
    support for no_proxy, which breaks the tests on Ubuntu autopkgtest.
    We don't actually need Internet access, so this is OK.
  * debian/test.sh: Unexport HTTP proxy variables for build-time tests
    too
  * Make build-time test failures fatal if they fail at least twice
    out of 5 tries (previously they had to fail at least 3 times)
  * Add patch to reinstate test-libglnx-shutil.c, which was missed out
    of the upstream tarball

  * Classify new ostree-tmpfiles.conf as part of ostree-boot, and so
    don't install it yet
  * Stop copying an old ostree-trivial-httpd.xml from debian/dist/
    into source tree. Upstream distributes it again, and has since
    2017.8.
  * Add a patch to fix JavaScript tests with gjs 1.50.0, which is
    more strict about 'let'
  * Stop providing "ostree trivial-httpd" CLI, following upstream
    default behaviour. flatpak used to use it in its tests, but

  * Only run tests when building architecture-dependent packages.
    The tests aren't so interesting that we want to run them again

  * Add patches to make the tests pass again when /var/tmp is on tmpfs,

    - Add patch from upstream PR #1016 to fix a regression
  * Add a Breaks on flatpak (<< 0.8.7-2~), which rely on libostree to
    download the summary and its signature when mirroring.
    libostree >= 2017.7 no longer does this. On affected flatpak versions,
    this breaks installation of new apps and runtimes system-wide.
  * Add Build-Depends-Indep: libglib2.0-doc so gtk-doc can set up
    cross-references

ostree (2017.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Branch to experimental to avoid interfering with the Debian 9 freeze
  * Remove an unintended line in the previous changelog
  * New upstream release
    - trivial-httpd is now a separate binary. Move it to ostree-tests,
      so that it doesn't continue to pull in libsoup if the ostree
      downloader is ported to libcurl.
    - d/copyright: update
    - d/patches: drop all patches, applied upstream

    builds for experimental non-deterministically pulling in an older
    version of automake, in my case automake1.11 which is far too old.

    There are several upstream bugs that cause intermittent test
    failures, and can intermittently be reproduced in real use.
    However, these are not regressions, so we should not FTBFS just

  * d/p/pull-Correctly-handle-repo-parent_repo-when-applying-stat.patch:
    apply patch from upstream to fix a bug that flatpak currently works
    around
  * d/p/tests-fail-the-build-if-symlinking-tests-ostree-fails.patch,
    d/p/tests-use-our-own-generated-libtool-not-the-one-in-PATH.patch:
    add patches to ensure that the build-time tests act on the copy
    of ostree that we just built
  * d/p/entry_pathname_test_helper-these-tests-need-extended-attr.patch:
    skip more tests if /var/tmp doesn't support extended attributes
  * d/control: ostree no longer needs its Suggests on dracut. A stronger
    dependency on dracut will be needed in the ostree-boot package when
    the boot integration is reinstated (see #824650).

ostree (2016.5-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/p/test-sysroot.js-set-strict-mode-when-sourcing-libtest.sh.patch,
    d/p/tests-Use-strict-mode-by-default-for-C-tests.patch: add patches
    to make sure the tests fail as soon as something goes wrong
  * Build-depend on procps, used to check for leaked processes
  * debian/test.sh: factor out our dh_auto_test wrapper, and clean
    up any stray processes even if the test fails
  * If build-time tests fail, try 4 more times to get an idea of
    whether the failure is reproducible (hoping to diagnose #826858)
  * Add a patch to link libreaddir-rand to libdl, which should fix
    test failures on Ubuntu (Closes: #826857)

ostree (2016.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove ostree-grub2 and the boot-related parts of ostree, leaving
    the library and the command-line tool, which are also used by
    Flatpak.
    When we have documentation for how to use and test OSTree
    deployments with a Debian derivative (see #824649), they should be
    reinstated in an ostree-boot package (see #824650).
  * Upload to unstable.

ostree (2016.5-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Add a patch to skip the test-parent test if /var/tmp doesn't support
    user xattrs, hopefully fixing FTBFS on x86-csail-02 buildd

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Apr 2016 12:51:33 +0100

ostree (2016.3-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Prepare package for Debian (Closes: #697477)
  * New upstream release
  * Remove -dbg package, rely on automatic dbgsym packages instead
  * Extend package descriptions a bit
  * debian/.gitignore: add
  * debian/copyright: fill in all copyright holders and licenses
  * debian/control: set Maintainer to the pkg-utopia team, with packaging
    in collab-maint git, and myself and Matthias Klumpp as uploaders
  * Normalize packaging via `wrap-and-sort -abst`
  * debian/control: move shared library to Section: libs
  * debian/control: remove redundant Section
  * debian/control: change Section to admin
  * Remove unnecessary uses of dh-exec
  * debian/patches: remove all patches, no longer needed or applied
  * Use dh_install --fail-missing to catch mistakes
  * Add a symbols file
  * Add missing dependency on libglib2.0-dev
  * Add an ostree-tests package, and use it for autopkgtest
  * Enable systemd helpers, but do not start the early-boot systemd services
    on installation
  * Don't override dh_auto_clean to nothing
  * ostree-grub2: recommend concrete GRUB packages instead of hard-depending
    on a transitional package. This is only a Recommends because you
    could be using some other architecture's grub packages.
  * Redirect libexecdir to /usr/lib (not /usr/lib/${multiarch}) since we don't
    need multiarch for anything that's installed there, fixing a broken
    symlink in ostree-grub2
  * Document the limited situations in which ostree-grub2 will work in
    practice
  * Only build on Linux architectures; this package is specifically
    not portable
  * Add patch to fix underlinking of test-archive
  * Add patch to skip one build-time test if /var/tmp cannot support xattrs,
    for example if it is on tmpfs
  * Stop dh_makeshlibs thinking that the LD_PRELOAD module libreaddir-rand.so
    (part of the tests) is meant to be a shared library
  * Add a missing #!/bin/sh to one test
