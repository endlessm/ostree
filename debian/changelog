ostree (2017.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Drop all current patches, applied upstream
    - Update symbols file
  * Add some post-release bug fix patches
  * Simplify autopkgtest now that test-local-pull seems to be stable
  * Unexport HTTP proxy variables in autopkgtest to work around lack of
    support for no_proxy, which breaks the tests on Ubuntu autopkgtest.
    We don't actually need Internet access, so this is OK.
  * debian/test.sh: Unexport HTTP proxy variables for build-time tests
    too
  * Make build-time test failures fatal if they fail at least twice
    out of 5 tries (previously they had to fail at least 3 times)
  * Add patch to reinstate test-libglnx-shutil.c, which was missed out
    of the upstream tarball

ostree (2017.11-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Replace patch with the version applied upstream in 2017.12
  * Standards-Version: 4.1.0 (no changes)
  * Add a patch to fix FTBFS in non-English locales
  * Add a patch to fix FTBFS if building as root with umask != 022,
    which for some reason debomatic does (Closes: #876138)
  * Add a patch from upstream to fix undefined behaviour with
    O_RDONLY|O_CREAT in rofiles-fuse

ostree (2017.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Drop all current patches, applied upstream
    - Update symbols file
  * Adjust Description and Upstream-Name to emphasize libostree
  * Classify new ostree-tmpfiles.conf as part of ostree-boot, and so
    don't install it yet
  * Stop copying an old ostree-trivial-httpd.xml from debian/dist/
    into source tree. Upstream distributes it again, and has since
    2017.8.
  * Add a patch to fix JavaScript tests with gjs 1.50.0, which is
    more strict about 'let'
  * Stop providing "ostree trivial-httpd" CLI, following upstream
    default behaviour. flatpak used to use it in its tests, but
    the version in stable no longer does.

ostree (2017.10-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Update symbols file
    - Install new bash completions
  * Use dh_missing --fail-missing instead of dh_install --fail-missing
  * Only run tests when building architecture-dependent packages.
    The tests aren't so interesting that we want to run them again
    when splitting -arch/-indep builds.
  * Add patches to make the tests pass again when /var/tmp is on tmpfs,
    which does not support user xattrs
  * Add patch to remove useless #! from bash completions
  * Make build-time test failures fatal again, but only if they are
    reproducible (at least 3 times out of 5) for now

ostree (2017.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Update symbols file
    - Remove patches that are no longer needed
    - Add patch from upstream PR #1016 to fix a regression
  * Add a Breaks on flatpak (<< 0.8.7-2~), which rely on libostree to
    download the summary and its signature when mirroring.
    libostree >= 2017.7 no longer does this. On affected flatpak versions,
    this breaks installation of new apps and runtimes system-wide.
  * Add Build-Depends-Indep: libglib2.0-doc so gtk-doc can set up
    cross-references

ostree (2017.5-1) experimental; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
    - This release fixes a regression in 2017.4 that caused symlinks
      in Flatpak apps and runtimes to be checked out as regular files.
      Any apps or runtimes that were installed or updated with 2017.4
      will need to be removed and reinstalled.

ostree (2017.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Branch to experimental to avoid interfering with the Debian 9 freeze
  * Remove an unintended line in the previous changelog
  * New upstream release
    - trivial-httpd is now a separate binary. Move it to ostree-tests,
      so that it doesn't continue to pull in libsoup if the ostree
      downloader is ported to libcurl.
    - d/copyright: update
    - d/patches: drop all patches, applied upstream
  * Explicitly depend on autoconf, automake, libtool. This avoids
    builds for experimental non-deterministically pulling in an older
    version of automake, in my case automake1.11 which is far too old.

    to work there at all (#827815)
    - d/ostree-tests.lintian-overrides: silence
      missing-dep-for-interpreter error on sparc64, where we install
      the script but do not attempt to run it
  * debian/tests/gnome-desktop-testing: Skip test-local-pull.sh.test

    d/p/Make-corrupt-repo-ref.js-executable.patch:
    Fix permissions and #! lines for some tests in the upstream build
    system
  * d/rules: remove workarounds for script permissions.
    The upstream build system now uses the intended permissions throughout.
    - Retain explicit chmod for *.js, which dh_fixperms assumes should
      not be executable.
  * d/p/Fix-TAP-syntax-in-test-basic-user.sh-and-run-it.patch:

ostree (2016.15-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make all test failures non-fatal at build time, so that intermittent
    test failures do not interfere with possible security updates during
    Debian stretch-as-stable.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Dec 2016 11:28:41 +0000

ostree (2016.15-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - d/patches: drop all patches, applied upstream

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Dec 2016 13:13:44 +0000

ostree (2016.14-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make build-time test failures non-fatal, as long as at least
    3 out of 5 attempts succeed.

    There are several upstream bugs that cause intermittent test
    failures, and can intermittently be reproduced in real use.
    However, these are not regressions, so we should not FTBFS just
    because we happen to have been unlucky during build.

  * d/p/Terminate-individual-tests-after-10-minutes.patch:
    replace d/p/debian/Terminate-individual-tests-after-half-an-hour.patch
    with the version that I sent upstream, which uses SIGABRT and
    terminates the tests sooner
  * d/p/*.patch: import more memory leak fixes from upstream

  * New upstream release

    in upstream git but not in tarballs

    David King
  * Install GObject-Introspection typelibs to multiarch path,
    and mark gir1.2-ostree-1.0 as Multi-Arch: same
  * libostree-dev: stop depending on ostree. It isn't necessary to
    use the library, and would break multiarch installability
  * Move to debhelper compat level 10
    - stop using dh --parallel, it's the default now
    - don't use autoreconf and systemd addons explicitly, they are
      the default now
  * d/p/dist/Retrieve-some-missing-test-files-from-upstream-git.patch:
    fetch missing test files from upstream git
    - debian/rules: make the missing scripts executable

  * Fix debian/watch (Closes: #827440)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * New upstream release
    - drop all patches, included upstream
    - update symbols file
    - this version is more careful about thread-safety, which appears
      to fix the test failures that caused FTBFS on mipsel
      (Closes: #827473)
  * d/watch: fetch releases from GitHub instead of GNOME

  * d/p/tests-fail-the-build-if-symlinking-tests-ostree-fails.patch,
    d/p/tests-use-our-own-generated-libtool-not-the-one-in-PATH.patch:
    add patches to ensure that the build-time tests act on the copy
    of ostree that we just built
  * d/p/entry_pathname_test_helper-these-tests-need-extended-attr.patch:
    skip more tests if /var/tmp doesn't support extended attributes
  * d/control: ostree no longer needs its Suggests on dracut. A stronger
    dependency on dracut will be needed in the ostree-boot package when
    the boot integration is reinstated (see #824650).

  * Build-depend on procps, used to check for leaked processes
  * debian/test.sh: factor out our dh_auto_test wrapper, and clean
    up any stray processes even if the test fails
  * If build-time tests fail, try 4 more times to get an idea of
    whether the failure is reproducible (hoping to diagnose #826858)
  * Add a patch to link libreaddir-rand to libdl, which should fix
    test failures on Ubuntu (Closes: #826857)

    the library and the command-line tool, which are also used by
    Flatpak.
    When we have documentation for how to use and test OSTree
    deployments with a Debian derivative (see #824649), they should be

  * debian/rules: warn if there are leftover daemon processes after testing
  * debian/ostree-tests.lintian-overrides: override a couple of false
    positives

  * Build-depend on elfutils, for test-abi.sh
  * Work around #821235 to avoid undefined macro 'AQ' in some man pages
  * Add a patch to put more information in the log if tests fail,
    in an attempt to debug a failure in test/pull-resume.sh which
    I can no longer reproduce

  * Don't override dh_auto_clean to nothing
  * ostree-grub2: recommend concrete GRUB packages instead of hard-depending
    on a transitional package. This is only a Recommends because you
    could be using some other architecture's grub packages.
  * Redirect libexecdir to /usr/lib (not /usr/lib/${multiarch}) since we don't
    need multiarch for anything that's installed there, fixing a broken
    symlink in ostree-grub2
  * Document the limited situations in which ostree-grub2 will work in
    practice
  * Only build on Linux architectures; this package is specifically
    not portable
  * Add patch to fix underlinking of test-archive
  * Add patch to skip one build-time test if /var/tmp cannot support xattrs,
    for example if it is on tmpfs
  * Stop dh_makeshlibs thinking that the LD_PRELOAD module libreaddir-rand.so
    (part of the tests) is meant to be a shared library
  * Add a missing #!/bin/sh to one test
