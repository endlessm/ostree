ostree (2016.5-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Add a patch to skip the test-parent test if /var/tmp doesn't support
    user xattrs, hopefully fixing FTBFS on x86-csail-02 buildd

ostree (2016.3-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Prepare package for Debian (Closes: #697477)
  * New upstream release
  * Remove -dbg package, rely on automatic dbgsym packages instead
  * Extend package descriptions a bit
  * debian/.gitignore: add
  * debian/copyright: fill in all copyright holders and licenses
  * debian/control: set Maintainer to the pkg-utopia team, with packaging
    in collab-maint git, and myself and Matthias Klumpp as uploaders
  * Normalize packaging via `wrap-and-sort -abst`
  * debian/control: move shared library to Section: libs
  * debian/control: remove redundant Section
  * debian/control: change Section to admin
  * Remove unnecessary uses of dh-exec
  * debian/patches: remove all patches, no longer needed or applied
  * Use dh_install --fail-missing to catch mistakes
  * Add a symbols file
  * Add missing dependency on libglib2.0-dev
  * Add an ostree-tests package, and use it for autopkgtest
  * Enable systemd helpers, but do not start the early-boot systemd services
    on installation
  * Don't override dh_auto_clean to nothing
  * ostree-grub2: recommend concrete GRUB packages instead of hard-depending
    on a transitional package. This is only a Recommends because you
    could be using some other architecture's grub packages.
  * Redirect libexecdir to /usr/lib (not /usr/lib/${multiarch}) since we don't
    need multiarch for anything that's installed there, fixing a broken
    symlink in ostree-grub2
  * Document the limited situations in which ostree-grub2 will work in
    practice
  * Only build on Linux architectures; this package is specifically
    not portable
  * Add patch to fix underlinking of test-archive
  * Add patch to skip one build-time test if /var/tmp cannot support xattrs,
    for example if it is on tmpfs
  * Stop dh_makeshlibs thinking that the LD_PRELOAD module libreaddir-rand.so
    (part of the tests) is meant to be a shared library
  * Add a missing #!/bin/sh to one test
