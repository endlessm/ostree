ostree (2016.5-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/p/test-sysroot.js-set-strict-mode-when-sourcing-libtest.sh.patch,
    d/p/tests-Use-strict-mode-by-default-for-C-tests.patch: add patches
    to make sure the tests fail as soon as something goes wrong
  * Build-depend on procps, used to check for leaked processes
  * debian/test.sh: factor out our dh_auto_test wrapper, and clean
    up any stray processes even if the test fails
  * If build-time tests fail, try 4 more times to get an idea of
    whether the failure is reproducible (hoping to diagnose #826858)
  * Add a patch to link libreaddir-rand to libdl, which should fix
    test failures on Ubuntu (Closes: #826857)

ostree (2016.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove ostree-grub2 and the boot-related parts of ostree, leaving
    the library and the command-line tool, which are also used by
    Flatpak.
    When we have documentation for how to use and test OSTree
    deployments with a Debian derivative (see #824649), they should be
    reinstated in an ostree-boot package (see #824650).
  * Upload to unstable.

ostree (2016.5-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Add a patch to skip the test-parent test if /var/tmp doesn't support
    user xattrs, hopefully fixing FTBFS on x86-csail-02 buildd

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Apr 2016 12:51:33 +0100

  * Fix ITP bug number in changelog (was #813308, should have been #697477)

    I can no longer reproduce
  * Standards-version: 3.9.8 (no changes needed)

ostree (2016.3-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Prepare package for Debian (Closes: #697477)
  * New upstream release
  * Remove -dbg package, rely on automatic dbgsym packages instead
  * Extend package descriptions a bit
  * debian/.gitignore: add
  * debian/copyright: fill in all copyright holders and licenses
  * debian/control: set Maintainer to the pkg-utopia team, with packaging
    in collab-maint git, and myself and Matthias Klumpp as uploaders
  * Normalize packaging via `wrap-and-sort -abst`
  * debian/control: move shared library to Section: libs
  * debian/control: remove redundant Section
  * debian/control: change Section to admin
  * Remove unnecessary uses of dh-exec
  * debian/patches: remove all patches, no longer needed or applied
  * Use dh_install --fail-missing to catch mistakes
  * Add a symbols file
  * Add missing dependency on libglib2.0-dev
  * Add an ostree-tests package, and use it for autopkgtest
  * Enable systemd helpers, but do not start the early-boot systemd services
    on installation
  * Don't override dh_auto_clean to nothing
  * ostree-grub2: recommend concrete GRUB packages instead of hard-depending
    on a transitional package. This is only a Recommends because you
    could be using some other architecture's grub packages.
  * Redirect libexecdir to /usr/lib (not /usr/lib/${multiarch}) since we don't
    need multiarch for anything that's installed there, fixing a broken
    symlink in ostree-grub2
  * Document the limited situations in which ostree-grub2 will work in
    practice
  * Only build on Linux architectures; this package is specifically
    not portable
  * Add patch to fix underlinking of test-archive
  * Add patch to skip one build-time test if /var/tmp cannot support xattrs,
    for example if it is on tmpfs
  * Stop dh_makeshlibs thinking that the LD_PRELOAD module libreaddir-rand.so
    (part of the tests) is meant to be a shared library
  * Add a missing #!/bin/sh to one test
