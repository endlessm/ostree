ostree (2016.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Force LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 during build, so that builds in non-English
    locales can pass their build-time tests
  * New upstream release
  * Build-depend on ca-certificates. glib-networking now generates
    warnings if those are missing, causing the build-time tests to fail.

ostree (2016.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Relicense debian/ from GPL-2+ to LGPL-2+, with permission from
    David King
  * Install GObject-Introspection typelibs to multiarch path,
    and mark gir1.2-ostree-1.0 as Multi-Arch: same
  * libostree-dev: stop depending on ostree. It isn't necessary to
    use the library, and would break multiarch installability
  * Move to debhelper compat level 10
    - stop using dh --parallel, it's the default now
    - don't use autoreconf and systemd addons explicitly, they are
      the default now
  * d/p/dist/Retrieve-some-missing-test-files-from-upstream-git.patch:
    fetch missing test files from upstream git
    - debian/rules: make the missing scripts executable

ostree (2016.10-0) master; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (T13340)
  * Resync debian packaging changes. Downstream changes still kept:
    - Have our ostree package still maintaining the parts needed for
      boot rather than being split out into an ostree-boot package.
    - The grub2 files are manually removed before dh_install since we
      only want the Grub BLS support.
    - Add deprecation rules for old package names (T11513)

ostree (2016.9-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches/Terminate-individual-tests-after-half-an-hour.patch:
    terminate individual tests after 30 minutes, in an attempt to debug
    what happened on the ppc64el buildd

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 09 Sep 2016 08:23:44 +0100

ostree (2016.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    - update symbols file for new ABI
    - update copyright file
    - update ostree-boot packaging: the utilities in /usr/sbin moved to
      /usr/lib/ostree
    - drop libgsystem build-dependency
    - d/p/Makefile-tests.am-make-check-uses-the-built-binaries.patch:
      drop, applied upstream
  * Explicitly build-depend on xsltproc, which is directly used

ostree (2016.9-0) master; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (T13117)
    - Remove the libgsystem-dev build dependency as it has been dropped
      upstream.
    - Update symbols file for new ABI.
    - Add Endless specific ostree_repo_delete_compat_signature and
      ostree_repo_get_commit_sizes ABIs to symbols file. These are
      specified to the 2016.3 version like all older symbols.
    - Update ostree-prepare-root and ostree-remount install paths.
      These are now installed under /usr/lib/ostree.
    - Add build dependency on latest libc6-dev for non-x86 to get a
      corrected definition of O_TMPFILE in glibc.
      See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769453 for details.
  * Resync debian packaging changes
    - Add Build-Depends on libsystemd-dev
    - Add missing Depends on cpio for ostree-tests package
    - Remove the ostree-grub2 package as was done upstream. However,
      our ostree package still maintains the parts needed for boot
      rather than being split out into an ostree-boot package. The
      grub2 files are manually removed before dh_install since we
      only want the Grub BLS support.
    - Pull in libostree-1-1.symbols updates.

ostree (2016.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    - drop all patches, applied upstream
    - build-depend on libsystemd (unconditionally, because this package is
      Linux-specific already)
    - update symbols file for new ABI
  * d/p/Makefile-tests.am-make-check-uses-the-built-binaries.patch:
    add patch from upstream to make sure we use the built binaries for
    build-time testing
  * d/control: mention Flatpak, not its former name xdg-app

ostree (2016.6-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Switch sense of check in debian/test.sh so we really ignore test
    failures on mipsel, and not on !mipsel.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 06 Jul 2016 15:23:31 +0100

ostree (2016.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ignore build-time test failures on mipsel. "ostree pull"
    intermittently fails with a bus error on at least some mipsel CPUs,
    and applying gdb to the resulting core dump does not produce any
    useful information. Debugging help would be appreciated.
    (Mitigates: #827473)

ostree (2016.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/p/tests-Improve-check-for-proc-cmdline-kargs.patch: add patch from
    upstream fixing FTBFS on host machines without root= in /proc/cmdline,
    such as the reproducible builds armhf workers
  * d/control, d/copyright: use the GitHub repository as the Homepage
    and Source: the GNOME wiki page is less frequently updated

ostree (2016.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * Fix debian/watch (Closes: #827440)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * New upstream release
    - drop all patches, included upstream
    - update symbols file
    - this version is more careful about thread-safety, which appears
      to fix the test failures that caused FTBFS on mipsel
      (Closes: #827473)
  * d/watch: fetch releases from GitHub instead of GNOME
  * d/gbp.conf: configure to use upstream/latest for upstream imports
  * d/gbp.conf: configure to merge upstream tags into upstream/latest
    (add https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree as a remote)
  * d/p/libostree.sym-Fix-test-symbols.patch: apply patch from upstream
    to fix a build-time test
  * d/p/pull-Correctly-handle-repo-parent_repo-when-applying-stat.patch:
    apply patch from upstream to fix a bug that flatpak currently works
    around
  * d/p/tests-fail-the-build-if-symlinking-tests-ostree-fails.patch,
    d/p/tests-use-our-own-generated-libtool-not-the-one-in-PATH.patch:
    add patches to ensure that the build-time tests act on the copy
    of ostree that we just built
  * d/p/entry_pathname_test_helper-these-tests-need-extended-attr.patch:
    skip more tests if /var/tmp doesn't support extended attributes
  * d/control: ostree no longer needs its Suggests on dracut. A stronger
    dependency on dracut will be needed in the ostree-boot package when
    the boot integration is reinstated (see #824650).

ostree (2016.6-0) master; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, rebase debian packaging
    - Debian's ostree-boot package split left out for now.

 -- Dan Nicholson <nicholson@endlessm.com>  Fri, 24 Jun 2016 10:04:51 -0700

ostree (2016.5-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/p/test-sysroot.js-set-strict-mode-when-sourcing-libtest.sh.patch,
    d/p/tests-Use-strict-mode-by-default-for-C-tests.patch: add patches
    to make sure the tests fail as soon as something goes wrong
  * Build-depend on procps, used to check for leaked processes
  * debian/test.sh: factor out our dh_auto_test wrapper, and clean
    up any stray processes even if the test fails
  * If build-time tests fail, try 4 more times to get an idea of
    whether the failure is reproducible (hoping to diagnose #826858)
  * Add a patch to link libreaddir-rand to libdl, which should fix
    test failures on Ubuntu (Closes: #826857)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Jun 2016 15:35:18 -0400

ostree (2016.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove ostree-grub2 and the boot-related parts of ostree, leaving
    the library and the command-line tool, which are also used by
    Flatpak.
    When we have documentation for how to use and test OSTree
    deployments with a Debian derivative (see #824649), they should be
    reinstated in an ostree-boot package (see #824650).
  * Upload to unstable.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 08 Jun 2016 11:58:01 +0100

ostree (2016.5-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Add a patch to skip the test-parent test if /var/tmp doesn't support
    user xattrs, hopefully fixing FTBFS on x86-csail-02 buildd

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Apr 2016 12:51:33 +0100

    - debian/rules: use Debian's grub2-mkconfig path
  * debian/gbp.conf: use DEP-14 branch names; disable numbered patches
  * Fix ITP bug number in changelog (was #813308, should have been #697477)
  * debian/control: build-depend on attr, for the tests (only required if
    /var/tmp supports extended attributes)
  * debian/rules: clean up stale gpg-agent processes after testing
  * debian/rules: warn if there are leftover daemon processes after testing
  * debian/ostree-tests.lintian-overrides: override a couple of false
    positives
  * Run dh_auto_test with VERBOSE=1, to get logs with older debhelper
  * Build-depend on elfutils, for test-abi.sh
  * Work around #821235 to avoid undefined macro 'AQ' in some man pages
  * Add a patch to put more information in the log if tests fail,
    in an attempt to debug a failure in test/pull-resume.sh which
    I can no longer reproduce
  * Standards-version: 3.9.8 (no changes needed)

ostree (2016.3-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Prepare package for Debian (Closes: #697477)
  * New upstream release
  * Remove -dbg package, rely on automatic dbgsym packages instead
  * Extend package descriptions a bit
  * debian/.gitignore: add
  * debian/copyright: fill in all copyright holders and licenses
  * debian/control: set Maintainer to the pkg-utopia team, with packaging
    in collab-maint git, and myself and Matthias Klumpp as uploaders
  * Normalize packaging via `wrap-and-sort -abst`
  * debian/control: move shared library to Section: libs
  * debian/control: remove redundant Section
  * debian/control: change Section to admin
  * Remove unnecessary uses of dh-exec
  * debian/patches: remove all patches, no longer needed or applied
  * Use dh_install --fail-missing to catch mistakes
  * Add a symbols file
  * Add missing dependency on libglib2.0-dev
  * Add an ostree-tests package, and use it for autopkgtest
  * Enable systemd helpers, but do not start the early-boot systemd services
    on installation
  * Don't override dh_auto_clean to nothing
  * ostree-grub2: recommend concrete GRUB packages instead of hard-depending
    on a transitional package. This is only a Recommends because you
    could be using some other architecture's grub packages.
  * Redirect libexecdir to /usr/lib (not /usr/lib/${multiarch}) since we don't
    need multiarch for anything that's installed there, fixing a broken
    symlink in ostree-grub2
  * Document the limited situations in which ostree-grub2 will work in
    practice
  * Only build on Linux architectures; this package is specifically
    not portable
  * Add patch to fix underlinking of test-archive
  * Add patch to skip one build-time test if /var/tmp cannot support xattrs,
    for example if it is on tmpfs
  * Stop dh_makeshlibs thinking that the LD_PRELOAD module libreaddir-rand.so
    (part of the tests) is meant to be a shared library
  * Add a missing #!/bin/sh to one test
