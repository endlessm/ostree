 License

 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN
 AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE
 MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 a.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
     work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic
     work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations
     or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
     a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
     for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
     Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization
     of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b.  "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
     such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in
     Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement
     of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work
     is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
     other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
     in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A
     work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
     (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
 c.  "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
     copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
     transfer of ownership.
 d.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 e.  "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
     the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if
     no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition
     (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers,
     and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
     otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
     (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
     entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds;
     and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
     the broadcast.
 f.  "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
     terms of this License including without limitation any production
     in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
     mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
     pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of
     the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic
     work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without
     words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed
     by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
     architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic
     work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous
     to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
     sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
     architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram;
     a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
     work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent
     it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 g.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from
     the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
     violation.
 h.  "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
     Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
     means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
     individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
     means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
     of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
     rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
 i.  "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
     without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation
     and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
     performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
 b.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
     clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
     to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
     original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
     could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
     in Collections; and,
 d.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 e.  For the avoidance of doubt:
    i.   Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
         in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
         the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
         You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii.  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
         in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
         Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
         licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the
         rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
     terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
     Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
     Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
     any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
     ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
     that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
     the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute
     or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work,
     You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
     rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
     Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
     this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
     made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
     You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
     credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 b.  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
     or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
     to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
     name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
     and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
     or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
     for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
     terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
     or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
     reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
     notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with
     Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the
     use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work
     by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in
     any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation
     or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for
     all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
     as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
     credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt,
     You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
     attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
     under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
     any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
     of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of
     the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 c.  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
     or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
     derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
     the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
     jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
     in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
     deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
     Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
     fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
     to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
     (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
 OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
     License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
     licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
     full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
 b.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
     here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
     the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work
     at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
     to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
     continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
     the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
     and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
     the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
     by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 d.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
     and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
     appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
     without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f.  The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
     the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
     1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,
     the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
     Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and
     subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the
     License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
     provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
     applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
     applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under
     this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
     License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
     rights under applicable law.
