Description: content-addressed filesystem for operating system binaries (introspection)
 OSTree is a tool for managing bootable, immutable, versioned filesystem
 trees. See the ostree package's description for more details.
 .
 This package contains GObject-Introspection metadata, which can be used
 to generate dynamic bindings into languages such as Python and JavaScript.

Description: content-addressed filesystem for operating system binaries (library)
 OSTree is a tool and library for managing bootable, immutable, versioned
 filesystem trees. It is like git in that it checksums individual files
 and has a content-addressed object store; unlike git, it "checks out"
 the files using hardlinks into an immutable directory tree. This
 can be used to provide atomic upgrades with rollback, history and
 parallel-installation, particularly useful on "fixed purpose" systems
 such as embedded devices. It is also used by the Flatpak application
 runtime system.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
