Description: content-addressed filesystem for operating system binaries (introspection)
 libostree provides a library and tools for managing bootable, immutable,
 versioned filesystem trees. See the ostree package's description for
 more details.
 .
 This package contains GObject-Introspection metadata, which can be used
 to generate dynamic bindings into languages such as Python and JavaScript.

Description: content-addressed filesystem for operating system binaries (library)
 libostree is a library for managing bootable, immutable, versioned
 filesystem trees. It is like git in that it checksums individual files
 and has a content-addressed object store; unlike git, it "checks out"
 the files using hardlinks into an immutable directory tree. This
 can be used to provide atomic upgrades with rollback, history and
 parallel-installation, particularly useful on "fixed purpose" systems
 such as embedded devices. It is also used by the Flatpak application
 runtime system.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: libostree boot loader and initramfs integration
 libostree provides a library and tools for managing bootable, immutable,
 versioned filesystem trees. See the ostree package's description for
 more details.
 .
 This package contains configuration snippets and executables needed to
 boot a Debian derivative from a libostree filesystem deployment. This
 integration currently has some limitations:
 .
  - the initramfs must have been made using dracut
  - the boot loader must be one that is supported by libostree, currently
    GNU GRUB 2, syslinux/extlinux or Das U-Boot
