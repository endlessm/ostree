This package contains configuration snippets for using ostree with GRUB 2.
This integration currently has some limitations:

  - the initramfs must have been made using dracut
  - the root filesystem must be one that dracut can mount without a root=
    command-line argument (an EFI partition with the GUID defined in
    the Discoverable Partitions specification[1])
  - /boot must be a separate partition
