This is a GPG config directory for use with the OstreeGpgVerifyResult
test cases. The test data (`lgpl2`) is signed with a variety of valid
and invalid GPG keys in a detached signature file (`lgpl2.sig`). In
addition, each detached signature is available in a separate file
(`lgpgl2.sig<N>`).

The passphrase for all the keys is `redhat`.
