 * @title: Mock GIO volume interfaces
 * @short_description: Mock implementations of GIO volume, mount and drive
 *    interfaces
 * @stability: Unstable
 * @include: tests/test-mock-gio.h
 *
 * A set of classes implementing GIO interfaces for volumes, mounts, drives
 * and volume monitoring, which return mock data to the caller when used. These
 * are designed for use in unit tests, to mock up removable drives when testing
 * code which monitors such drives being added and removed and then queries
 * properties of them.
 *
 * By returning mock drive locations to the caller, for example, the contents of
 * a removable drive may be mocked up using temporary files.
 *
 * Currently, all the mock data returned by these classes to callers is static,
 * set at construction time.
 *
 * Since: 2017.8
